# Student Sign In - App
An application built with React Native that allows students to sign in with their phone, and professors to see student sign in data.

Bluetooth is used to ensure the student is actually in the classroom.

Uses [StudentSignIn-api](https://github.com/nathan815/StudentSignIn-api) for backend.
